# Support Vector Machine (Linearly-Seperable)
SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.

# Design a Linear SVM to classify Non Linearly separable Data Points given Below.
Data Points for Positive Labels
[2,2] [2,-2] [-2,-2] [-2,2]

Data Pijts for Negative Labels
[-1,1] [1,-1] [-1,-1] [-1,1]
